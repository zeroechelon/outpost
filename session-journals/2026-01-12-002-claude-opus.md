# Session 002: Outpost V2 Blueprint Generation

## Executive Summary

Fleet recovered from connectivity outage. Generated comprehensive depth-5 blueprint for Outpost V2 Commander Platform transformation. Blueprint committed to isolated `v2-commander-platform` branch.

## Work Completed

### 1. Fleet Recovery
- **Issue**: SSM agent ConnectionLost, SSH timeouts to 34.195.223.189
- **Root Cause**: Lightsail server frozen/hung
- **Resolution**: Commander rebooted via Lightsail console
- **Verification**: All 5 agents (Claude, Codex, Gemini, Aider, Grok) responding

### 2. Outpost V2 Gap Analysis
Analyzed transformation scope from v1.8.1 prototype to production multi-tenant SaaS:
- Single Lightsail → ECS Fargate cluster
- Directory isolation → Container-per-dispatch
- Internal use → 1000+ daily users
- Flagship models only → Multi-tier model selection
- No billing → Ledger integration

**Estimated Effort**: 7-8 weeks, ~80% new code

### 3. Branch Creation
```bash
git checkout -b v2-commander-platform
git push -u origin v2-commander-platform
```
Current v1.8.1 protected on `main`.

### 4. Blueprint Generation
**File**: `blueprints/OUTPOST_V2_COMMANDER_PLATFORM.bp.md`
**Lines**: 3843
**Depth**: 5 (maximum granularity)
**Tasks**: 186 across 11 tiers

| Tier | Focus | Tasks |
|------|-------|-------|
| T0 | Foundation (MCP contracts, schemas) | 15 |
| T1 | AWS Infrastructure (Terraform) | 22 |
| T2 | Container Images (5 agents) | 18 |
| T3 | Control Plane (FastAPI service) | 24 |
| T4 | Workspace Management (EFS) | 16 |
| T5 | MCPify & Ledger Integration | 20 |
| T6 | Security (IAM, secrets) | 18 |
| T7 | Monitoring (CloudWatch, alerts) | 14 |
| T8 | Performance (warm pool, scaling) | 16 |
| T9 | Testing (integration, load) | 22 |
| T10 | Migration (cutover plan) | 21 |

**Key Specifications**:
- Agent Model Registry with multi-tier support per family (haiku/sonnet/opus, etc.)
- 7 MCP tool schemas for MCPify integration
- Ledger cost event schema for billing
- Warm pool pattern for <5s cold starts
- EFS workspace management (ephemeral + persistent modes)

## Commits This Session

| Hash | Message |
|------|---------|
| `69d3ce22` | blueprint: Add OUTPOST_V2_COMMANDER_PLATFORM depth-5 specification |

## Artifacts Generated

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `blueprints/OUTPOST_V2_COMMANDER_PLATFORM.bp.md` | Complete v2 transformation blueprint |

## Blueprint Status

```
OUTPOST_V2_COMMANDER_PLATFORM.bp.md
Progress: 0/186 tasks (0%)
Status: Ready for execution
Next: T0 - Foundation (MCP interface contracts)
```

## Next Session Recommendations

1. **Begin T0 Execution**: MCP interface contracts have no dependencies
2. **Review Model Registry**: Validate agent model tiers with Commander requirements
3. **MCPify Coordination**: Ensure MCPify provider ready for new tool schemas
4. **Terraform Init**: Stand up development environment for T1
