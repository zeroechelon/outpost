# Session 001: Initialization and Usage Investigation

## Work Since Last Save

### Actions Taken
- Initialized zeOS v5.5.0 and loaded Outpost project context.
- Created session journal stub and committed to repository.
- Researched `!fuel` command heuristics in `FUEL_COMMANDS.md`.
- Attempted to locate subscription usage tokens for Gemini (searched common paths like `~/.zeos/tokens`, `projects/zeOS/.zeos/`, etc.).

### Decisions Made
- Deferring the Outpost V2 vs Ledger Phase 2 decision to the next session as per previous session recommendation.

### Commands Executed
- `cat /home/richie/projects/zeOS/kernel/SOUL.md` (and other kernel files during boot)
- `cat /home/richie/projects/zeOS/apps/outpost/OUTPOST_SOUL.md`
- `ls` and `find` commands for token discovery.

### Current Focus
Transitioning to blueprint execution (Ledger Phase 2 or Outpost V2).
