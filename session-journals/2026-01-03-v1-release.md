## Work Since Last Save

### Actions Taken

1. **Verified --yolo flag** — dispatch-gemini.sh already has `--yolo` for non-interactive execution
2. **Created dispatch-unified.sh** — Unified multi-agent dispatcher with:
   - `--executor=claude|codex|gemini` for single agent
   - `--executor=claude,codex` for multiple specific agents
   - `--executor=all` for parallel execution of all three
3. **Deployed to server** — Via SSM to `/home/ubuntu/claude-executor/dispatch-unified.sh`
4. **Created OUTPOST_INTERFACE.md** — Cross-project API contract enabling any zeOS Claude session to invoke Outpost
5. **Tagged v1.0** — First stable release of three-agent fleet
6. **Updated zeOS REGISTRY** — Added `version: 1.0` and `interface_doc` field

### Files Committed

**rgsuarez/outpost:**
- `scripts/dispatch-unified.sh` — Unified dispatcher (new)
- `OUTPOST_INTERFACE.md` — Cross-project interface spec (new)
- Tag: `v1.0`

**rgsuarez/zeOS:**
- `apps/REGISTRY.json` — Added version and interface_doc to Outpost entry

### Decisions Made

- **v1.0 release approved** — Three-agent fleet fully operational
- **Interface pattern chosen** — OUTPOST_INTERFACE.md serves as the cross-project API contract
- **Unified dispatcher design** — Single script handles all invocation patterns

### Current Focus

Outpost v1.0 released. Cross-project invocation enabled.

## Next Action Primer

Outpost is now callable from any zeOS project. To use from another project (e.g., Geaux File):
1. Read `OUTPOST_INTERFACE.md` from outpost repo
2. Use SSM commands with appropriate credentials
3. Dispatch to single, multiple, or all agents

Test cross-project invocation from a different zeOS session.
