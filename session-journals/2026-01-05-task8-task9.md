## Work Since Last Save

### Actions Taken
- Connected to SOC server (mi-0d77bfe39f630bd5c) via SSM
- Verified claude-executor directory contents (4.4GB total)
- Removed all Outpost infrastructure:
  - runs/ (4.0GB - 194 run directories)
  - repos/ (366MB - cached repos)
  - dispatch*.sh (all 5 dispatch scripts)
  - scripts/ (helper scripts)
  - .env (API keys)
  - backup-v1.3/
  - AGENTS_README.md
  - .cache-lock-* files
  - .scripts-sync
- Removed entire /home/ubuntu/claude-executor directory
